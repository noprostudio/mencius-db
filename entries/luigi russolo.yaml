  extract: Luigi Carlo Filippo Russolo (30 April 1885 – 6 February 1947) was an Italian
    Futurist painter, composer, builder of experimental musical instruments, and the
    author of the manifesto The Art of Noises (1913). He is often regarded as one
    of the first noise music experimental composers with his performances of noise
    music concerts in 1913–14 and then again after World War I, notably in Paris in
    1921. He designed and constructed a number of noise-generating devices called
    Intonarumori.
