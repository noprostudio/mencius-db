  extract: Francis Warren Nicholls, Jr. (January 18, 1955 – March 31, 2014), better
    known as Frankie Knuckles, was an American DJ, record producer and remixer. He
    played an important role in developing and popularizing house music in Chicago
    during the 1980s, when the genre was in its infancy. In 1997, Knuckles won the
    Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical. Due to his importance in
    the development of the genre, Knuckles was often called "The Godfather of House
    Music".
