Released from his eponymous album in late 1970, it was a crossover hit, spending four non-consecutive weeks at number-one on Billboard Soul chart and peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100.The song was recorded and produced by Wardell Quezergue at Malaco Records' Jackson, Mississippi recording studios during the same session as another Quezergue-produced song, Jean Knight's \"Mr. Big Stuff\".  \"Groove Me\" was originally released as the B-side to Floyd's \"What Our Love Needs\" on the Malaco subsidiary Chimneyville.  When New Orleans disc jockey George Vinnett started playing the B-side, the song began meriting attention, and as the record emerged as a local smash, Atlantic Records scooped up national distribution rights.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "跟我缠绵", "details": "“缠绵”好像过于温柔"}, {"user_name": "redhousepainter", "github_handle": "redhousepainter", "translation": "缠绵", "details": "就两个字缠绵反而效果更好，翻成共赴云雨之类的反而有点露骨"}]}
