According to the origin story of the Abrahamic religions, she was the first woman. Eve is known also as Adam's wife.\nAccording to the second chapter of Genesis, Eve was created by God (Yahweh) by taking her from the rib of Adam, to be Adam's companion. Adam is charged with guarding and keeping the garden before her creation; she is not present when God commands Adam not to eat the forbidden fruit. She succumbs to the serpent's temptation to eat the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. She shares the fruit with Adam, and as a result the first humans are expelled from the Garden of Eden. Christian churches differ on how they view both Adam and Eve's disobedience to God (often called the fall of man), and to the consequences that those actions had on the rest of humanity. Christian and Jewish teachings sometimes hold Adam (the first man) and Eve to a different level of responsibility for the fall, although Islamic teaching holds both equally responsible.\nAlong with Adam, the Catholic Church by ancient tradition recognizes Eve as a saint. The traditional liturgical feast of Saints Adam and Eve has been celebrated on 24 December since the Middle Ages in many European nations, including Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, and the Scandinavian nations."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "夏娃", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "Lil Bag", "github_handle": "Lil-Bag", "translation": "伊芙", "details": ""}]}
