  extract: "Mary Mary are a female American gospel duo composed of sisters Erica Atkins-Campbell\
    \ and Trecina Atkins-Campbell. Formed in 1998, Mary Mary was launched into mainstream\
    \ recognition following the release of their best-selling debut album, Thankful\
    \ (2000), which contained the hit single \"Shackles (Praise You)\". Their followup\
    \ album Incredible (2002), reached number one on the Top Gospel Albums chart.\
    \ Their self-titled third album, Mary Mary (2005), which contains themes the public\
    \ interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, contains the worldwide hits\
    \ \"Heaven\", \"The Real Party\", and \"Yesterday\". \nTheir fourth album The\
    \ Sound (2008) spawned the number-one singles \"Get Up\" and \"God in Me\". In\
    \ 2011, they released their fifth studio album \"Something Big\" and followed\
    \ up with a compilation album \"Go Get It\" in 2012 before going on hiatus. In\
    \ March 2012, they premiered their own television series, Mary Mary, on WE tv.\
    \ \nMary Mary has sold more than eight million records worldwide to date. The\
    \ duo have been nominated for eleven Grammy Awards, winning four times including\
    \ once Best Gospel Performance and for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album. The\
    \ duo are often credited for broadening the fan base of urban contemporary gospel\
    \ in the 2000s by introducing elements of soul music, hip hop, funk and jazz.\
    \ The group's name is inspired by two famous Marys from the Bible: Mary, mother\
    \ of Jesus, and Mary Magdalene. They also performed at the White House in 2005."
