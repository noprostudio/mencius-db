(short for Respect Missy Elliott) is the first greatest hits album by American rapper-songwriter Missy Elliott, released by Atlantic Records on September 4, 2006 in Europe, Asia and Australia. It includes a collection of the singles from across all six of her studio albums, released between 1997 and 2005. Speculation about two new tracks on the album began soon after its announcement. Two tracks called \"123\" and \"Magnifica\" were supposed to be included; \"123\" was even able to be pre-ordered as a CD single from UK music store HMV. However, these songs did not make the album.\nMissing from the collection is the US single \"Take Away\". This track was omitted as, in most countries in Europe in 2001, the more successful Basement Jaxx dance remix of \"4 My People\" was released in its place. Another notable omission is the exclusion of the single/video version of \"One Minute Man\" with Trina and the single remix of \"Hot Boyz\". There are no new tracks featured on the collection.\nRespect M.E. became her second top ten album in the UK and her highest charting album to date, peaking at number seven. On September 29, 2006, it was certified Gold by the BPI, for sales of over 100,000 units in the UK, and has sold 500,000 copies worldwide. In 2007, the album became available in Best Buy stores in the United States."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "唯我独尊", "details": ""}]}
