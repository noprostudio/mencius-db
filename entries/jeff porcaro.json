He is best known for his work with the rock band Toto, but is one of the most recorded session musicians, working on hundreds of albums and thousands of sessions. While already an established studio player in the 1970s, he came to prominence in the United States as the drummer on the Steely Dan album Katy Lied.\nAllMusic has characterized him as \"arguably the most highly regarded studio drummer in rock from the mid-'70s to the early '90s\", and says that \"it is no exaggeration to say that the sound of mainstream pop/rock drumming in the 1980s was, to a large extent, the sound of Jeff Porcaro.\" He was posthumously inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "杰夫·波尔卡罗", "details": ""}]}
