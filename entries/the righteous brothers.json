They began performing together in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called the Paramours, but adopted the name \"The Righteous Brothers\" when they embarked on their recording career as a duo. Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and 70s, and although the duo was inactive for some years, Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003.\nHatfield and Medley had contrasting vocal ranges, which helped them to create a distinctive sound as a duet, but also strong vocal talent individually that allowed them to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his bass-baritone voice, with Hatfield taking the higher register vocals with his tenor voice.\nThey had their first major hit with the 1964 song \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\", produced by Phil Spector and often considered one of his finest works. Other notable hits include \"Ebb Tide\", \"Soul and Inspiration\", \"Rock and Roll Heaven\", and in particular, their version of \"Unchained Melody\". Both Hatfield and Medley also had for a time their own solo careers. In 2016, Medley re-formed The Righteous Brothers with Bucky Heard and they continue to perform as a duo."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "正义兄弟", "details": ""}]}
