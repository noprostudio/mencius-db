It was released on April 19, 1994, by Columbia Records. After signing with the label with the help of MC Serch, Nas recorded the album in 1992 and 1993 at Chung King Studios, D&D Recording, Battery Studios, and Unique Recording Studios in New York City. The album's production was handled by DJ Premier, Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, L.E.S. and Nas himself. Styled as a hardcore hip hop album, Illmatic features multi-syllabic internal rhymes and inner-city narratives based on Nas' experiences in Queensbridge, New York.\nThe album debuted at number 12 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 63,000 copies in its first week. However, its initial sales fell below expectations and its five singles failed to achieve significant chart success. Despite the album's low initial sales, Illmatic received rave reviews from most music critics, who praised its production and Nas' lyricism. On January 17, 1996, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and on December 11, 2001, it earned a platinum certification after shipping 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album has sold 2 million copies in the United States as of February 6, 2019.\nSince its initial reception, Illmatic has been recognized by writers and music critics as a landmark album in East Coast hip hop. Its influence on subsequent hip hop artists has been attributed to the album's production and Nas' lyricism. It also contributed to the revival of the New York City rap scene, introducing a number of stylistic trends to the region. The album is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time, appearing on numerous best album lists by critics and publications."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "举世无敌", "details": "为了能让后来的《Stillmatic》叫“仍旧无敌”"}, {"user_name": "Lil Bag", "github_handle": "Lil-Bag", "translation": "举世无双/无与伦比", "details": "这也是一个永恒难题。 台湾人建议叫“屌学” 。。。Nas claimed that the name\"Illmatic\" (meaning \"beyond ill\" or \"the ultimate\") was areference to his incarcerated Queensbridge friend, Illmatic Ice. Nas later described the title name as \"supreme ill. It's as ill as illgets. That shit is a science of everything ill.\". 就叫“举世无双” 或者“无与伦比”吧"}]}
