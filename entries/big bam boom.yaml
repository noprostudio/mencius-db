  extract: 'Big Bam Boom is the twelfth studio album by Daryl Hall & John Oates, released
    by RCA Records on October 12, 1984. It marked the end of one of the most successful
    album runs by a duo of the 1980s. RCA issued a remastered version in July 2004
    with four bonus tracks. The song "Out of Touch" (the first single) was a #1 pop
    hit, and charted in several other areas (#24 Hot Black Singles, #8 on the Adult
    Contemporary charts and #1 on the dance charts, #48 in the UK). Another song taken
    from the album, the Daryl Hall and Janna Allen-penned "Method of Modern Love"
    reached a high point of #5, and "Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid," reached
    #18.

    Musical styles on the album include pop, rock, and dance-rock, with R&B/soul influences.
    The album had even more of an electronic, urban feel to it compared to their previous
    albums, combining their song structure & vocalization with the latest technical
    advances in recording and playing. The album employed some of the most sophisticated
    equipment ever used in the recording industry at the time.Big Bam Boom peaked
    at No. 5 in the United States and sold over three million copies worldwide.'
