  extract: 'Future Shock is a 1970 book by the futurist Alvin Toffler,in which the
    author defines the term "future shock" as a certain psychological state of individuals
    and entire societies. The shortest definition for the term in the book is a personal
    perception of "too much change in too short a period of time". The book, which
    became an international bestseller, grew out of an article "The Future as a Way
    of Life" in Horizon magazine, Summer 1965 issue. The book has sold over 6 million
    copies and has been widely translated.

    A documentary film based on the book was released in 1972 with Orson Welles as
    on-screen narrator.'
