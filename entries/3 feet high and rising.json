It is the first of three collaborations with producer Prince Paul, which would become the critical and commercial peak of both parties. The album title comes from the Johnny Cash song \"Five Feet High and Rising\". The album contains the singles \"Me Myself and I\", \"The Magic Number\", \"Buddy\", and \"Eye Know\".\nCritically, as well as commercially, the album was a success. It is consistently placed on lists of the greatest albums of all time by noted critics and publications, with Robert Christgau calling it \"unlike any rap album you or anybody else has ever heard\".  In 1998, it was selected as one of The Source Magazine's \"100 Best Rap Albums\". It was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "高过三英尺", "details": ""}]}
