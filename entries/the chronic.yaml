  extract: "The Chronic is the debut studio album by American hip hop producer and\
    \ rapper Dr. Dre. It was released on December 15, 1992, by his own record label\
    \ Death Row Records and distributed by Interscope Records. Recording sessions\
    \ for the album took place in June 1992 at Death Row Studios in Los Angeles and\
    \ at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. The album is named after a slang\
    \ term for high-grade cannabis, and its cover is an homage to Zig-Zag rolling\
    \ papers. It was Dr. Dre's first solo album after he had departed from hip hop\
    \ group N.W.A and its label Ruthless Records over a financial dispute. \nOn The\
    \ Chronic, he included both subtle and direct insults at Ruthless and its owner,\
    \ former N.W.A member Eazy-E. Although a solo album, it features many appearances\
    \ by then-emerging American rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, who used the album as a launch\
    \ pad for his own solo career. \nThe Chronic peaked at number three on the Billboard\
    \ 200 and has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association\
    \ of America with sales of 3 million copies in the United States, which led to\
    \ Dr. Dre becoming one of the top ten best-selling American performing artists\
    \ of 1993. The Chronic spent eight months in the Billboard Top 10. The album's\
    \ three singles became top ten Billboard singles. \"Nuthin' but a \"G\" Thang\"\
    \ peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number one on both the\
    \ Hot Rap Singles and Hot R&B Singles charts.Dr. Dre's production has been noted\
    \ for popularizing the G-funk subgenre within gangsta rap. The Chronic has been\
    \ widely regarded as one of the most important and influential albums of the 1990s\
    \ and regarded by many fans and peers to be one of the most well-produced hip\
    \ hop albums of all time. The Chronic was ranked at 138 on Rolling Stone's 500\
    \ Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2020, the album was selected by the Library\
    \ of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"\
    culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n"
