He emerged in New York's downtown underground creative scene in the late 1970s as a camera operator and a regular guest on Glenn O'Brien's public access cable show TV Party. There he met Chris Stein and Debbie Harry. He was immortalized in 1981 when Harry rapped on the Blondie song \"Rapture\" that \"Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody's fly.\" In the late 1980s, Fab 5 Freddy became the first host of the groundbreaking and first internationally telecast hip-hop music video show Yo! MTV Raps."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "五绝·弗莱迪", "details": ""}]}
