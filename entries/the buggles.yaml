  extract: "The Buggles were an English new wave band formed in London in 1977 by\
    \ singer and bassist Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoffrey Downes. They are best\
    \ known for 1979 debut single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which topped the\
    \ UK Singles Chart and reached number one in 15 other countries.\nThe duo released\
    \ their first album, The Age of Plastic, in January 1980 with \"Video Killed the\
    \ Radio Star\" as its lead single. Soon after the album's release, Horn and Downes\
    \ joined the progressive rock band Yes, recording and releasing Drama in the process.\
    \ Following a tour to promote the album, Yes disbanded in 1981. That same year,\
    \ on 1 August, the music video for \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" became the\
    \ first ever shown on MTV in the US. The following year, the Buggles released\
    \ a second album, Adventures in Modern Recording. Its lack of commercial success\
    \ led to the break up of the group. Since 1998, Horn and Downes have occasionally\
    \ performed the Buggles' songs. \nIn October 2011, the Buggles reunited to play\
    \ at the British Music Experience at the O2 Arena in London. At the 2016 Progressive\
    \ Music Awards, the Buggles won an \"Outer Limit Award\".\n\n"
