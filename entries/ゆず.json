Its members are Yūjin Kitagawa (北川悠仁, Kitagawa Yūjin) and Kōji Iwasawa (岩沢厚治, Iwasawa Kōji). Both of the band members come from Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture, and attended \nOkamura Junior High School. Their songs \"Hyōri Ittai\" (表裏一体, Two sides of the same coin), \"Reason\", and \"Nagareboshi Kirari\" (流れ星キラリ, Shooting star) were used as ending themes of the 2011 anime series Hunter × Hunter.Yuzu started out as street musicians. At first, the band's name was \"Light's\", but Kitagawa disliked it, so they changed the name to \"Yuzu\". At that time, Kitagawa was eating a yuzu sherbet, so he named the band after the fruit (incidentally, Iwasawa was eating vanilla ice cream so the band's name might have been \"Vanilla\" - sometimes Iwasawa tells this story). The fans of Yuzu are called \"Yuzukko (ゆずっ子)\"."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "柚子", "details": ""}]}
