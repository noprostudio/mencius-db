The object balls include seven solid-colored balls numbered 1 through 7, seven striped balls numbered 9 through 15, and the black 8 ball. After the balls are scattered with a break shot, a player is assigned either the group of solid or striped balls once they have legally pocketed a ball from that group. The object of the game is to legally pocket the 8 ball in a \"called\" pocket, which can only be done after all of the balls from a player's assigned group have been cleared from the table.\nThe game is the most frequently played discipline of pool, and is often thought of as synonymous with \"pool\". The game has numerous variations, mostly regional. It is the second most played professional pool game, after nine-ball, and for the last several decades ahead of straight pool."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "8号球与MJG", "details": ""}]}
