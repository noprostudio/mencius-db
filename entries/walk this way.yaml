  extract: '"Walk This Way" is a song by the American hard rock band Aerosmith. Written
    by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, the song was originally released as the second
    single from the album Toys in the Attic (1975). It peaked at number 10 on the
    Billboard Hot 100 in early 1977, part of a string of successful hit singles for
    the band in the 1970s. In addition to being one of the songs that helped break
    Aerosmith into the mainstream in the 1970s, it also helped revitalize their career
    in the 1980s when it was covered by hip hop group Run–D.M.C. on their 1986 album
    Raising Hell. This cover was a touchstone for the new musical subgenre of rap
    rock, or the melding of rock and hip hop. It became an international hit and won
    both groups a Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap Single in 1987 Soul Train Music
    Awards.'
