Released on March 25, 1979, a few months before \"Rapper's Delight\" (which is widely regarded as the first commercially released hip hop song), this song is often cited as the beginning of recorded hip hop. The title refers to vocalist Tim Washington.\nThe song was originally the B-Side of the 7-inch single, with the A-Side \"You're My Candy Sweet\" a mid-tempo disco song. However the song stalled at #67 after 4-weeks on the R&B chart and was replaced the following week with \"King Tim III (Personality Jock)\" on the chart. It peaked at #26 on the R&B chart and stayed on for 11 weeks."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handler": "mimida", "translation": "提姆王三世", "details": ""}]}
