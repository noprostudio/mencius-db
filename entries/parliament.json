Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries. The term is similar to the idea of a senate, synod or congress, and is commonly used in countries that are current or former monarchies, a form of government with a monarch as the head. Some contexts restrict the use of the word parliament to parliamentary systems, although it is also used to describe the legislature in some presidential systems (e.g. the Parliament of Burundi), even where it is not in the official name.\nHistorically, parliaments included various kinds of deliberative, consultative, and judicial assemblies, e.g. medieval parliaments."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handler": "mimida", "translation": "百乐门", "details": "维基上说名称来源“Parliament”香烟，香烟通常译作“百乐门”：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament-Funkadelic"}, {"user_name": "redhousepainter", "github_handler": "redhousepainter", "translation": "百乐门", "details": "george在建立乐团之初请来了不少歌手，严格来说是一支合唱组合。当时的合唱组合喜欢以鸟名，汽车品牌，香烟品牌命名，george考虑到香烟带着一点成人感和危险感，是一种挺酷的标志，而Parliament是当时著名的香烟品牌，于是就借来用作乐团名。"}]}
