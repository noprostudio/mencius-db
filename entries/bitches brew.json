It marked his continuing experimentation with electric instruments that he had previously featured on the critically acclaimed In a Silent Way (1969). With these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis rejected traditional jazz rhythms in favor of loose, rock-influenced arrangements based on improvisation.\nThe album initially received a mixed response, due to its unconventional style and experimental sound. It gained momentum and became Davis's highest charting album on the U.S. Billboard 200, peaking at No. 35. In 1976, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, reflecting shipments of 250,000 copies. In 1971, it won a Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album.In subsequent years, Bitches Brew gained recognition as one of jazz's greatest albums and a progenitor of the jazz rock genre, as well as a major influence on rock and funk musicians. In 1998, Columbia released  The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions, a four-disc box set that includes the original album and previously unreleased material. In 2003, the album was certified platinum for selling one million copies."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "即兴精酿", "details": "泼妇精酿"}]}
