  extract: 'P-Funk (also spelled P Funk or P. Funk) refers to the repertoire, musical
    style, and/or group of performers associated with George Clinton. The term is
    variously known as an abbreviation of Parliament-Funkadelic, Psychedelic Funk,
    Pure Funk, or Plainfield Funk.

    The P-Funk groups had their heyday in the 1970s and continue to attract new fans
    thanks both to the legacy of samples they bequeathed to hip hop and the live shows
    that the bands continue to perform. Their music was very aspirational, which is
    symbolized by their Mothership that has since been acquired by the Smithsonian.
    Notable P-Funk albums include Funkadelic''s Maggot Brain and Parliament''s Mothership
    Connection. The differing styles of these albums showcase the wide range of P-Funk''s
    music. "Maggot Brain was an explosive record" of Jimi Hendrix inspired rock while
    Mothership Connection was an "album of science-fiction funk." While this rock/funk
    differentiation is what normally separated Funkadelic from Parliament, the bands
    consisted of many of the same members and performed live on tour together. Hence,
    the two groups are often described under the one moniker Parliament-Funkadelic.

    P-Funk recordings have been extensively sampled in rap and hip-hop music, especially
    by Dr. Dre and other West Coast acts, beginning in the late 1980s and being particularly
    associated with the G-funk style of rap.'
