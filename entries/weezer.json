Since 2001, the band has consisted of Rivers Cuomo (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), Patrick Wilson (drums), Brian Bell (guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Scott Shriner (bass, backing vocals).\nAfter signing to Geffen Records in 1993, Weezer released its self-titled debut album, also known as the Blue Album, in 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles \"Buddy Holly\", \"Undone – The Sweater Song\", and \"Say It Ain't So\", the Blue Album became a multiplatinum success. Weezer's second album, Pinkerton (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and Pinkerton are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for Pinkerton, bassist Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.\nIn 2001, Weezer returned with the Green Album, with new bassist Mikey Welsh. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun\", the album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left the band and was replaced by current bassist Scott Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, Maladroit (2002), achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. Make Believe (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"Beverly Hills\" became Weezer's first single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and the first to reach the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100.\nIn 2008, Weezer released the Red Album, featuring \"TR-808s, synths, Southern rap, and baroque counterpoint\". Its lead single, \"Pork and Beans\", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a  Grammy-winning YouTube music video. Raditude (2009) and Hurley (2010) featured more \"modern pop production\" and songs co-written with other artists, achieved further mixed reviews and moderate sales. The band's ninth and tenth albums, Everything Will Be Alright in the End (2014) and the White Album (2016), returned to a rock style and achieved more positive reviews. Their eleventh album, Pacific Daydream (2017), featured a more mainstream pop sound. In 2019, Weezer released an album of covers, the Teal Album, followed by the Black Album. Weezer has sold 10.2 million albums in the US and over 35 million worldwide.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "威瑟", "details": ""}]}
