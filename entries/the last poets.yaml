  extract: 'The Last Poets are several groups of poets and musicians who arose from
    the late 1960s African-American civil rights movement''s black nationalism. The
    name is taken from a poem by the South African revolutionary poet Keorapetse Kgositsile,
    who believed he was in the last era of poetry before guns would take over. The
    original users of that name were the trio of Felipe Luciano, Gylan Kain, and David
    Nelson.

    The versions of the group led by Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin and Umar Bin Hassan
    had the largest impact on popular culture. The Last Poets were one of the earliest
    influences on hip-hop music. Critic Jason Ankeny wrote: "With their politically
    charged raps, taut rhythms, and dedication to raising African-American consciousness,
    the Last Poets almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for the emergence of
    hip-hop." The British music magazine NME stated, "Serious spokesmen like Gil Scott-Heron,
    The Last Poets, and later Gary Byrd, paved the way for the many socially committed
    Black [emcees] a decade later."'
