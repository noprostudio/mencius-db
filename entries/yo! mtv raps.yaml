  extract: 'Yo! MTV Raps is a two-hour television music video program, which first
    aired on MTV Europe from 1987 to mid-90s and on MTV US from August 1988 to August
    1995. The program (created by Ted Demme and Peter Dougherty) was the first hip
    hop music show on the network, based on the original MTV Europe show, aired one
    year earlier. Yo! MTV Raps produced a mix of rap videos, interviews with rap stars,
    live in studio performances (on Fridays) and comedy. The show also yielded a Brazilian
    version called Yo! MTV and broadcast by MTV Brasil from 1990 to 2005.
