They are best known for 1979 debut single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which topped the UK Singles Chart and reached number one in 15 other countries.\nThe duo released their first album, The Age of Plastic, in January 1980 with \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" as its lead single. Soon after the album's release, Horn and Downes joined the progressive rock band Yes, recording and releasing Drama in the process. Following a tour to promote the album, Yes disbanded in 1981. That same year, on 1 August, the music video for \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" became the first ever shown on MTV in the US. The following year, the Buggles released a second album, Adventures in Modern Recording. Its lack of commercial success led to the break up of the group. Since 1998, Horn and Downes have occasionally performed the Buggles' songs. \nIn October 2011, the Buggles reunited to play at the British Music Experience at the O2 Arena in London. At the 2016 Progressive Music Awards, the Buggles won an \"Outer Limit Award\".\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handler": "idmimida", "translation": "巴格斯", "details": ""}]}
