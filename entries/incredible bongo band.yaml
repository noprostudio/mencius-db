  extract: 'The Incredible Bongo Band, also known as Michael Viner''s Incredible Bongo
    Band, was a project started in 1972 by Michael Viner, a record artist manager
    and executive at MGM Records. Viner was called on to supplement the soundtrack
    to the  B-film The Thing With Two Heads. The band''s output consisted of upbeat,
    funky, instrumental music. Many tracks were covers of popular songs of the day
    characterized by the prominence of bongo drums, conga drums, rock drums and brass.

    Bongo Rock was featured in Robert Dimery''s book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before
    You Die.
