He rose to prominence in the early 2010s as the co-founder and de facto leader of alternative hip hop group Odd Future, and has performed on and produced songs for nearly every Odd Future release.Following a large contribution to Odd Future's early work, Tyler released his debut solo mixtape Bastard in 2009. After releasing his debut studio album Goblin via XL Recordings in April 2011, he signed a joint deal with RED Distribution and Sony Music Entertainment for himself and his label Odd Future Records. With his gritty, horrorcore-influenced earlier releases, Tyler was often criticized for his use of homophobic and misogynistic slurs in his lyrics. He released the albums Wolf (2013) and Cherry Bomb (2015), the latter of which was considered to be a contrast from his previous releases as he experimented with a more melody-focused and jazz-fused sound. His fourth album, Flower Boy (2017) was met with widespread acclaim. His fifth album, Igor (2019), was also acclaimed by critics, became Tyler's first number-one album on the Billboard 200, and won Best Rap Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards.Tyler has won a Grammy Award, a Brit Award, and an MTV Video Music Award. He created the cover art for all of Odd Future's releases, and has also designed the group's clothing and other merchandise. In 2011, Tyler started the clothing company Golf Wang. In 2012, he began hosting an annual music festival named the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. He created his own streaming service app named Golf Media, which ran between 2015 and 2018 and contained original scripted series from Tyler and a live stream of each Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "创造者泰勒", "details": ""}]}
