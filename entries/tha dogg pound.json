They were signed to Death Row Records in their early careers and were key to the label's success.\nKurupt and Daz went on to release solo albums starting in 1998. They eventually left the crumbling Death Row Records in 1999. Daz left due to long-lasting internal struggles on the label after friend and labelmate Tupac Shakur's murder in 1996. Kurupt started Antra Records, while Daz and Soopafly started D.P.G. Recordz. In 2002 a feud arose between the two when Kurupt decided to sign back with Death Row Records, upsetting everyone involved with the group. His awaited Death Row release Against Tha Grain had been postponed several times while Kurupt was on the label, later being released in August 2005, after he was off. In January 2005, Daz made another solo album release titled Tha Dogg Pound Gangsta LP. Tha Dogg Pound then got back together as a group and released Dillinger & Young Gotti II in November 2005. In 2006 Snoop Dogg decided to get involved and the three released their official reunion album Cali Iz Active.\nAn extended family, referred to as D.P.G.C. (short for Dogg Pound Gangsta Crips), is made up of Tha Dogg Pound, Warren G, Wayniac & Trip Loc (Tha Twinz), Lil' ½, RBX, Bad Azz, Dr Dre, Bow Wow, Lil Malik & Jamal (Illegal), The D.O.C., The L.B.C. Crew, and The Foesom, who were called Tha Dogg Pound Gangstaz, are commonly featured on one another's albums and projects."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "狗狗圈", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "Lil Bag", "github_handle": "Lil-Bag", "translation": "狗狗帮", "details": ""}]}
