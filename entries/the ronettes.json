One of the most popular groups of the 1960s, they placed nine songs on the Billboard Hot 100, five of which became Top 40 hits. The trio from Spanish Harlem, New York, consisted of lead singer Veronica Bennett (later known as Ronnie Spector), her older sister Estelle Bennett, and their cousin Nedra Talley. Among the Ronettes' most famous songs are \"Be My Baby\", \"Baby, I Love You\", \"(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up\", and \"Walking in the Rain\", all of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Walking in the Rain\" won a Grammy Award in 1965, and \"Be My Baby\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. The Ronettes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.\nThe girls had sung together since they were teenagers, then known as \"The Darling Sisters\". Signed first by Colpix Records in 1961, they moved to Phil Spector's Philles Records in March 1963 and changed their name to \"The Ronettes\". In late 1964, the group released their only studio album, Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica, which entered the Billboard charts at number 96. Rolling Stone ranked it number 422 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004. The Ronettes were the only girl group to tour with the Beatles."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "罗妮特", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "Tian Tang", "github_handle": "Tian-Tang", "translation": "罗特妮合唱团  / 罗特妮姐妹", "details": ""}]}
