  extract: 'McCartney is the debut solo album by English musician Paul McCartney,
    released on 17 April 1970 by Apple Records. He recorded the album in secrecy,
    mostly using basic home-recording equipment at his house in St John''s Wood. Mixing
    and some later recording took place at professional studios in London. In its
    preference for loosely arranged performance, McCartney eschewed the polish of
    the Beatles'' past records in favour of a lo-fi style. Apart from occasional contributions
    by his wife, Linda, he performed the entire album alone by overdubbing on four-track
    tape.

    McCartney recorded the album during a period of depression and confusion, following
    John Lennon''s private announcement in September 1969 that he was leaving the
    Beatles. Conflicts over the release of McCartney''s album further estranged him
    from his bandmates, as he refused to delay the album''s release to allow for Apple''s
    previously scheduled titles, notably the Beatles'' album Let It Be. A press release
    in the form of a self-interview, supplied with UK promotional copies of McCartney,
    led to the announcement of the group''s break-up.

    On release, the album received mostly negative reviews, while McCartney was vilified
    for seemingly ending the Beatles. The record was widely criticised for being under-produced
    and for its unfinished songs, although the ballad "Maybe I''m Amazed" was consistently
    singled out for praise. Commercially, McCartney benefited from the publicity surrounding
    the break-up; it held the number 1 position for three weeks on the US Billboard
    Top LPs before yielding that position to Let It Be. It peaked at number 2 in Britain.
    In 2011, the album was reissued with bonus tracks as part of the Paul McCartney
    Archive Collection.
