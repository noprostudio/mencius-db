wikipedia:
  extract: 'In medicine, confusion is the quality or state of being bewildered or
    unclear. The term "acute mental confusion" is often used interchangeably with
    delirium in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
    Health Problems and the Medical Subject Headings publications to describe the
    pathology. These refer to the loss of orientation, or the ability to place oneself
    correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. Mental confusion
    is sometimes accompanied by disordered consciousness (the loss of linear thinking)
    and memory loss (the inability to correctly recall previous events or learn new
    material). The term is from Latin: confusĭo, -ōnis, from confundere: "to pour
    together", "to mingle together", "to confuse".'
