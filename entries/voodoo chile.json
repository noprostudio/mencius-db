It is based on the Muddy Waters blues song \"Rollin' Stone\", but with original lyrics and music. At fifteen minutes, it is Hendrix's longest studio recording and features additional musicians in what has been described as a studio jam. \n\"Voodoo Chile\" was recorded at the Record Plant in New York City, after a late night jam session with Hendrix, Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell, organist Steve Winwood, and bassist Jack Casady. The song became the basis for \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\", recorded by the Experience the next day and one of Hendrix's best-known songs. \n\"Chile\" is a phonetic approximation of \"child\" without the \"d\". In the UK, \"Voodoo Chile\" was also used as the title of the 1970 single release of \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\", that has caused confusion regarding the two songs."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "会巫术的孩子", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "Tian Tang", "github_handle": "Tian-Tang", "translation": "巫毒孩子", "details": " 这个感觉中文见过不少次"}, {"user_name": "redhousepainter", "github_handle": "redhousepainter", "translation": "巫术娃儿", "details": ""}]}
