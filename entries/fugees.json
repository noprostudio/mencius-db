Their repertoire included elements of hip hop, soul and Caribbean music, particularly reggae. The members of the group were Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill, and Pras Michel. Deriving their name from a shortening of the word \"refugees\", Jean and Michel are Haitian while Hill is American.\nBefore disbanding in 1997, the group recorded two albums, one of which, The Score (1996), was a multi-Platinum and Grammy-winning success and contains their hit single \"Killing Me Softly\". Hill and Jean each went on to successful solo recording careers; Michel focused on soundtrack recordings and acting, though he found commercial success with his song \"Ghetto Supastar\". In 2007, MTV ranked them the ninth greatest hip-hop group of all time."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "流亡者", "details": ""}]}
