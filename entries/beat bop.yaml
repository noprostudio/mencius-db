wikipedia:
  extract: '"Beat Bop" is a hip hop single by American rappers Rammellzee and K-Rob,
    originally released in 1983 by record label Tartown. It was initially distributed
    merely as a test pressing. Its cover was designed by New York City graffiti artist
    Jean-Michel Basquiat. The result of a disagreement between Rammellzee and Basquiat,
    the track has been cited as having an influence on artists such as Beastie Boys
    and many experimental hip hop artists due to its chaotic, abstract sound.

    Due to the rarity of its original pressing, it has been called the Holy Grail
    of rap records. It is featured in the hip-hop documentary film Style Wars.'
