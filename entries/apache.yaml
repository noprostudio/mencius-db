  extract: 'The Apache () are a group of culturally related Native American tribes
    in the Southwestern United States, which include the  Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan,
    Mescalero, Salinero, Plains and Western Apache. Distant cousins of the Apache
    are the Navajo, with which they share the Southern Athabaskan languages. There
    are Apache communities in Oklahoma, Texas, and reservations in Arizona and New
    Mexico. Apache people have moved throughout the United States and elsewhere, including
    urban centers. The Apache Nations are politically autonomous, speak several different
    languages and have distinct cultures.

    Historically, the Apache homelands have consisted of high mountains, sheltered
    and watered valleys, deep canyons, deserts, and the southern Great Plains, including
    areas in what is now Eastern Arizona, Northern Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua) and
    New Mexico, West Texas, and Southern Colorado. These areas are collectively known
    as Apacheria. The Apache tribes fought the invading Spanish and Mexican peoples
    for centuries. The first Apache raids on Sonora appear to have taken place during
    the late 17th century.  In 19th-century confrontations during the American-Indian
    wars, the U.S. Army found the Apache to be fierce warriors and skillful strategists.'
