The film, which co-stars John Saxon and Jim Kelly, was directed by Robert Clouse. It would be Bruce Lee's final completed film appearance before his death on 20 July 1973 at age 32. A joint American and Hong Kong action film production, it premiered in Los Angeles on 19 August 1973, one month after Lee's death. The film went on to gross an estimated US$350 million worldwide (equivalent to more than $1 billion adjusted for inflation), against a tight budget of $850,000. Having earned over 400 times its budget, it is one of the most commercially successful and profitable films of all time.\nEnter the Dragon is widely regarded as one of the greatest martial arts films of all time. In 2004, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Among the first films to combine martial arts action with the emerging blaxploitation genre, its success led to a series of similar productions combining both genres.\nIts themes have also generated scholarly debate about how they reflect the changes taking place within post-colonial Asian societies following the end of World War II. Enter the Dragon is also considered one of the most influential action films of all time, with its success contributing to mainstream worldwide interest in martial arts as well as inspiring numerous fictional works including action films, television shows, fighting games, comic books, manga and anime.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "龙争虎斗", "details": ""}]}
