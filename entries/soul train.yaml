  extract: 'Soul Train is an American music-dance television program which aired in
    syndication from October 2, 1971, to March 27, 2006. In its 35-year history, the
    show primarily featured performances by R&B, soul, dance/pop, and hip hop artists,
    although funk, jazz, disco, and gospel artists also appeared.  The series was
    created by Don Cornelius, who also served as its first host and executive producer.

    Production was suspended following the 2005–2006 season, with a rerun package
    (known as The Best of Soul Train) airing for two years subsequently. As a nod
    to Soul Train''s longevity, the show''s opening sequence during later seasons
    contained a claim that it was the "longest-running first-run, nationally syndicated
    program in American television history," with over 1,100 episodes produced from
    the show''s debut through the 2005–2006 season. Despite the production hiatus,
    Soul Train held that superlative until 2016, when Entertainment Tonight surpassed
    it completing its 35th season. Among non-news programs, Wheel of Fortune surpassed
    that mark in 2018.'
