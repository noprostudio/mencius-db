wikipedia:
  extract: Funkadelic was an American band formed in 1968 and active until 1982. The
    band and its sister act Parliament, both led by George Clinton, pioneered the
    funk music culture of that decade. Relative to its sister act, Funkadelic pursued
    a heavier, psychedelic rock-oriented sound. They released acclaimed albums such
    as Maggot Brain (1971) and One Nation Under a Groove (1978).
