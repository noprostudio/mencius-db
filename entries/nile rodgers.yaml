  extract: 'Nile Gregory Rodgers Jr. (born September 19, 1952) is an American guitarist,
    singer-songwriter, record producer, arranger and composer. The co-founder of Chic,
    Rodgers has written, produced, and performed on albums that have cumulatively
    sold more than 500 million units and 75 million singles worldwide.  He is a Rock
    and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, a three-time Grammy Award-winner, and the chairman
    of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Known for his "chucking" guitar style, Rolling
    Stone wrote in 2014 that "the full scope of Nile Rodgers'' career is still hard
    to fathom."Formed as the Big Apple Band in 1972 with bassist Bernard Edwards,
    Chic released their self-titled debut album in 1977. It included the hit singles
    "Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)" and "Everybody Dance". The 1978
    album C''est Chic produced the hits "I Want Your Love" and "Le Freak", with the
    latter selling more than 7 million singles worldwide.  The song "Good Times" from
    the 1979 album Risqué  was a number one single on the pop and soul charts, and
    became one of the most-sampled songs of all time, "ushering in" hip-hop via The
    Sugarhill Gang''s "Rapper''s Delight", inspiring Queen''s "Another One Bites the
    Dust", and anchoring the Daft Punk hit  "Around the World".With Edwards, Rodgers
    wrote and produced music for other artists, including the songs "He''s the Greatest
    Dancer" and "We Are Family" for Sister Sledge and "I''m Coming Out" and "Upside
    Down" for Diana Ross. After Chic''s 1983 breakup Rodgers produced "a string of
    the post-disco era''s biggest albums and singles", including David Bowie''s Let''s
    Dance, "Original Sin" by INXS,  Duran Duran''s "The Reflex" and "Notorious", and
    Madonna''s Like a Virgin. He later worked with artists including The B-52s, Jeff
    Beck, Mick Jagger, The Vaughan Brothers, Bryan Ferry, Christina Aguilera, Lady
    Gaga, and  Daft Punk, winning three Grammy Awards in 2014 for his work on their
    album Random Access Memories.
