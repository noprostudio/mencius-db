  extract: '"Buffalo Gals" is a traditional American song, written and published as
    "Lubly Fan" in 1844 by the blackface minstrel John Hodges, who performed as "Cool
    White."   The song was widely popular throughout the United States, where minstrels
    often altered the lyrics to suit local audiences, performing it as "New York Gals"
    in New York City, "Boston Gals" in Boston, or "Alabama Girls" in Alabama, as in
    the version recorded by Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins on a 1959 field recording
    trip. The best-known version is named after Buffalo, New York.The chorus is:


    Buffalo gals, won''t you come out tonight?

    Come out tonight,

    Come out tonight?

    Buffalo gals, won''t you come out tonight,

    And dance by the light of the moon?The Western Writers of America chose it as
    one of the Top 100 Western Songs of all time.'
