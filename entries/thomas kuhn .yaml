  extract: 'Thomas Samuel Kuhn (; July 18, 1922 – June 17, 1996) was an American philosopher
    of science whose 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was influential
    in both academic and popular circles, introducing the term paradigm shift, which
    has since become an English-language idiom.

    Kuhn made several claims concerning the progress of scientific knowledge: that
    scientific fields undergo periodic "paradigm shifts" rather than solely progressing
    in a linear and continuous way, and that these paradigm shifts open up new approaches
    to understanding what scientists would never have considered valid before; and
    that the notion of scientific truth, at any given moment, cannot be established
    solely by objective criteria but is defined by a consensus of a scientific community.
    Competing paradigms are frequently incommensurable; that is, they are competing
    and irreconcilable accounts of reality. Thus, our comprehension of science can
    never rely wholly upon "objectivity" alone. Science must account for subjective
    perspectives as well, since all objective conclusions are ultimately founded upon
    the subjective conditioning/worldview of its researchers and participants.'
