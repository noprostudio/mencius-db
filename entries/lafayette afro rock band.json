Though little-known in their native United States during their recording period, they have since become celebrated as one of the standout funk bands of the 1970s and are particularly noted for their use of break beats. The band also recorded under the names Ice, Crispy & Co. (Krispie & Co. in Europe), Captain Dax, and others.Upon their relocation to Paris, the local music scene influenced the group's work, inspiring the addition of rock and African elements. They recorded their debut album as Ice and then adopted the name Lafayette Afro Rock Band. The band's next two albums, Soul Makossa and Malik, included the songs \"Hihache\" and \"Darkest Light\" which would be sampled in numerous culturally significant hip-hop compositions. They broke up in 1978."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "老佛爷非洲摇滚乐队", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "redhousepainter", "github_handle": "redhousepainter", "translation": "拉法耶特非洲摇滚乐队", "details": "Lafayette用音译。这个加注释吧：2004年第10期《wax poetics》上有一篇专辑制作人pierre jaubert的采访，他透露乐队名称起初叫ice，他借用乐队贝斯手Lafayette Hudson姓名中的一词 Lafayette ，给乐队取了一个复杂的长名Lafayette Afro Rock Band，这样易于专辑的注册和发行。"}]}
