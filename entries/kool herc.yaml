  extract: 'Clive Campbell (born April 16, 1955), better known by his stage name DJ
    Kool Herc, is a Jamaican DJ who is credited with helping originate hip hop music
    in the Bronx, New York City, in the 1970s through his "Back to School Jam", hosted
    on August 11, 1973, at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. After his younger sister, Cindy Campbell,
    became inspired to earn extra cash for back-to-school clothes, she decided to
    have her older brother, then 16 years old, play music for the neighborhood in
    their apartment building. Known as the "Founder of Hip-Hop" and "Father of Hip-Hop",
    Campbell began playing hard funk records of the sort typified by James Brown as
    an alternative both to the violent gang culture of the Bronx and to the nascent
    popularity of disco in the 1970s.

    Campbell began to isolate the instrumental portion of the record which emphasized
    the drum beat—the "break"—and switch from one break to another. Using the same
    two-turntable set-up of disco DJs, he used two copies of the same record to elongate
    the break. This breakbeat DJing, using funky drum solos, formed the basis of hip
    hop music. Campbell''s announcements and exhortations to dancers helped lead to
    the syncopated, rhythmically spoken accompaniment now known as rapping.

    He called the dancers "break-boys" and "break-girls", or simply b-boys and b-girls.
    Campbell''s DJ style was quickly taken up by figures such as Afrika Bambaataa
    and Grandmaster Flash. Unlike them, he never made the move into commercially recorded
    hip hop in its earliest years.
