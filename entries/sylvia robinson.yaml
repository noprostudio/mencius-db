  extract: 'Sylvia Robinson (née Vanterpool; May 29, 1935  – September 29, 2011) was
    an American singer, musician, record producer, and record label executive. Robinson
    had two R&B chart toppers: as half of Mickey & Sylvia with "Love Is Strange" in
    1957 and her solo record "Pillow Talk" in 1973. She later became known for her
    work as founder and CEO of the hip hop label Sugar Hill Records. Robinson is credited
    as the driving force behind two landmark singles in the hip hop genre; "Rapper''s
    Delight" (1979) by the Sugarhill Gang, and "The Message" (1982) by Grandmaster
    Flash and the Furious Five; which caused her to be dubbed "The Mother of Hip–Hop".
    Robinson received a Pioneer Award for her career in singing and being the founder
    of Sugarhill Records at the 11th Annual Rhythm and Blues Awards Gala in 2000.'
