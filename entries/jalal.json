Because of its majestic and glorious meanings, Jalal is used as an attribute of God in the Bible, Psalms and Christian hymns, and in the Quran, and as a characteristic of royals like kings, lords, monarchs, and emperors in histories, myths, legends, monarchies, and formal situations. When the Arabs spread their language across non-Arabic countries, \"Jalal\" among other Arabic words has been added to other language dictionaries of non-Arabic people. Many Arabic-speaking Christians and Arab or non-Arab Muslims have Jalal as given or family name.\n\nAnother form of the name is the Arabic spelling variant \"Galal\", mostly in the Egyptian Arabic dialect where the letter \"j\" or in Arabic \"ج\" is pronounced like the hard g /g/ in English as (garden, gather...), and it is written with the \"G\" to differentiate the pronunciation. The word \"Galal\" found in other languages or as country names could have other meanings."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "贾拉尔", "details": ""}]}
