Fresh (born September 17, 1966), is a Barbadian-born American rapper, record producer and beatboxer, also known as the \"Human Beat Box\". The pioneer of 20th-century American beatboxing, Fresh is able to accurately imitate drum machines and various special effects using only his mouth, lips, gums, throat, tongue and a microphone.\nIn the early 1980s he formed the Get Fresh Crew with DJs Chill Will and Barry B and later added rapper Slick Rick.  Two of their songs \"The Show\" and \"La Di Da Di\" are considered early hip hop classics.  \"La Di Da Di\", in particular, is one of the most sampled songs in music history."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "道格·E·弗莱什", "details": ""}]}
