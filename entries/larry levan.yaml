  extract: Larry Levan (; born Lawrence Philpot, July 20, 1954 – November 8, 1992)
    was an American DJ best known for his decade-long residency at the New York City
    night club Paradise Garage, which has been described as the prototype of the modern
    dance club. He developed a cult following who referred to his sets as "Saturday
    Mass". Influential post-disco DJ François Kevorkian credits Levan with introducing
    the dub aesthetic into dance music. Along with Kevorkian, Levan experimented with
    drum machines and synthesizers in his productions and live sets, ushering in an
    electronic, post-disco sound that presaged the ascendence of house music. He DJ'd
    at Club Zanzibar in the 1980s as well, home to the Jersey Sound brand of deep
    house or garage house.
