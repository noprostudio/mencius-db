He developed a cult following who referred to his sets as \"Saturday Mass\". Influential post-disco DJ François Kevorkian credits Levan with introducing the dub aesthetic into dance music. Along with Kevorkian, Levan experimented with drum machines and synthesizers in his productions and live sets, ushering in an electronic, post-disco sound that presaged the ascendence of house music. He DJ'd at Club Zanzibar in the 1980s as well, home to the Jersey Sound brand of deep house or garage house."}, "opinions": [{"mimida": {"user_name": "mimida", "github_handler": "mimida", "translation": "拉里·莱文", "details": ""}}]}
