It was one of the first drum machines to allow users to program rhythms instead of using preset patterns. Unlike its nearest competitor at the time, the more expensive Linn LM-1, the 808 generates sounds using analog synthesis rather than playing samples.\nLaunched when electronic music had yet to become mainstream, the 808 received mixed reviews for its unrealistic drum sounds and was a commercial failure. After building approximately 12,000 units, Roland discontinued the 808 after its semiconductors became impossible to restock. It was succeeded by the TR-909 in 1983. \nOver the course of the 1980s, the 808 attracted a cult following among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market, ease of use, and idiosyncratic sounds, particularly its deep, \"booming\" bass drum. It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic, dance, and hip hop genres, popularized by early hits such as \"Sexual Healing\" by Marvin Gaye and \"Planet Rock\" by Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force.\nThe 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine. Its particular popularity in hip hop has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music, comparable to the Fender Stratocaster's impact on rock. Its sounds are included with music software and modern drum machines, and it has inspired numerous clones.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "心碎节拍", "details": ""}]}
