  extract: Michael Ames Viner ( VEE-nər; February 27, 1944 – August 8, 2009) was an
    American film producer and record producer, who later shifted into book publishing
    and became an innovator in the audiobook field. A widely sampled percussion break
    in the recording of the song "Apache" by the Incredible Bongo Band, a group he
    assembled in the early 1970s, has been frequently integrated into many hip hop
    recordings.
