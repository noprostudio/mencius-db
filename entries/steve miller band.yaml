  extract: The Steve Miller Band is an American rock band formed in 1966 in San Francisco,
    California. The band is led by Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals. The group
    is best known for a string of (mainly) mid- to late-1970s hit singles that are
    staples of classic rock radio, as well as several earlier psychedelic rock albums.
    Miller left his first band to move to San Francisco and form the Steve Miller
    Blues Band. Shortly after Harvey Kornspan negotiated the band’s contract with
    Capitol Records in 1967, the band shortened its name to the Steve Miller Band.
    In February 1968, the band recorded its debut album, Children of the Future. It
    went on to produce the albums Sailor, Brave New World, Your Saving Grace, Number
    5, Rock Love, Fly Like an Eagle, Book of Dreams, and more. The band's Greatest
    Hits 1974–78, released in 1978, sold over 13 million copies. In 2016, Steve Miller
    was inducted as a solo artist in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
