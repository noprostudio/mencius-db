The duo's name is a concatenation of the members' names \"E\" and \"PMD\" or an acronym for \"Erick and Parrish Making Dollars\", referencing its members: emcees Erick Sermon (\"E\" a.k.a. E Double) and Parrish Smith (\"PMD\" a.k.a. Parrish Mic Doc). During an interview on college radio station WHOV in 1987, Parrish Smith stated that the name evolved from the original: \"We were originally known as \"EEPMD\" (Easy Erick and Parrish the Microphone Doctor), but chose to go with EPMD because it was easier to say.\" He also stated that they dropped the two \"E's\" because N.W.A.'s Eric Wright was already using \"Eazy-E\" as his stage name. The group has been active for 34 years (minus two breakups in 1992 and 1999), and is one of the most prominent acts in east coast hip hop. DJ K La Boss and DJ Scratch were DJs for the group and their current DJ is DJ Diamond J.\nThe word \"business\" is used in every title of the group's albums. Every album also has a track with \"Jane\" in the title."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "EPMD", "details": ""}]}
