In contrast to 1999's The Sounds of Science anthology, Solid Gold Hits consists only of tracks that were released as singles, with the exception of \"Shake Your Rump\". Where The Sounds of Science is a double CD compilation, Solid Gold Hits contains one CD with all their singles that broke gold, plus a DVD with the respective videos of the songs. Although the standard US release of the CD/DVD has 15 songs, the Japanese release has a bonus song and video, \"Right Right Now Now\"."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "至尊金曲精选", "details": ""}]}
