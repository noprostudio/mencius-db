It is played by holding the free end of the string known as the handle (by inserting one finger—usually the middle or index finger—into a slip knot), allowing gravity (or the force of a throw and gravity) to spin the yo-yo and unwind the string (similar to how a pullstring works). The player then allows the yo-yo to wind itself back to the player's hand, exploiting its spin (and the associated rotational energy). This is often called \"yo-yoing\". \nIn the simplest play, the string is intended to be wound on the spool by hand; The yo-yo is thrown downwards, hits the end of the string then winds up the string toward the hand, and finally the yo-yo is grabbed, ready to be thrown again. One of the most basic tricks is called the sleeper, where the yo-yo spins at the end of the string for a noticeable amount of time before returning to the hand."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "悠悠", "details": "瑶瑶？悠悠？"}, {"user_name": "Lil Bag", "github_handle": "Lil-Bag", "translation": "悠悠 ", "details": ""}]}
