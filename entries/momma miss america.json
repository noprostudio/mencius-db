He recorded the album in secrecy, mostly using basic home-recording equipment at his house in St John's Wood. Mixing and some later recording took place at professional studios in London. In its preference for loosely arranged performance, McCartney eschewed the polish of the Beatles' past records in favour of a lo-fi style. Apart from occasional contributions by his wife, Linda, he performed the entire album alone by overdubbing on four-track tape.\nMcCartney recorded the album during a period of depression and confusion, following John Lennon's private announcement in September 1969 that he was leaving the Beatles. Conflicts over the release of McCartney's album further estranged him from his bandmates, as he refused to delay the album's release to allow for Apple's previously scheduled titles, notably the Beatles' album Let It Be. A press release in the form of a self-interview, supplied with UK promotional copies of McCartney, led to the announcement of the group's break-up.\nOn release, the album received mostly negative reviews, while McCartney was vilified for seemingly ending the Beatles. The record was widely criticised for being under-produced and for its unfinished songs, although the ballad \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" was consistently singled out for praise. Commercially, McCartney benefited from the publicity surrounding the break-up; it held the number 1 position for three weeks on the US Billboard Top LPs before yielding that position to Let It Be. It peaked at number 2 in Britain. In 2011, the album was reissued with bonus tracks as part of the Paul McCartney Archive Collection.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"Tian-Tang": {"user_name": "Tian Tang", "github_handler": "Tian-Tang", "translation": "漂亮的美国小姐", "details": "momma是一个俗语，跟中国管人叫美女一个意思"}}]}
