wikipedia:
  extract: 'Perfume (UK: , US: ; French: parfum) is a mixture of fragrant essential
    oils or aroma compounds, fixatives and solvents, used to give the human body,
    animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable scent.

    It is usually in liquid form and used to give a pleasant scent to a person''s
    body.

    Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some
    of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century
    with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin,
    which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable
    solely from natural aromatics alone.'
