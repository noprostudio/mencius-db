It was supported by three singles: \"Can't Believe It\" featuring Lil Wayne, \"Chopped 'n' Skrewed\" featuring Ludacris, and \"Freeze\" featuring Chris Brown.\nReviews for the album were favorable but critics were growing weary of the party-filled track listing and overreliance on Auto-Tune. Three Ringz debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and spawned three singles: \"Can't Believe It\", \"Chopped 'n' Skrewed\" and \"Freeze\". It was nominated for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards, but lost to Beyoncé's I Am... Sasha Fierce."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "三环", "details": "stands for “Three Rings”"}]}
