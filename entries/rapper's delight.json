While it was not the first single to include rapping, \"Rapper's Delight\" is credited for introducing hip hop music to a wide audience, reaching the top 40 in the United States, as well as the top 3 in the UK and number-one in Canada. It was a prototype for various types of rap music, incorporating themes such as boasting, dance, honesty and sex, with the charisma and enthusiasm of James Brown. The track interpolates Chic's \"Good Times\", resulting in Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards suing Sugar Hill Records for copyright infringement; a settlement was reached that gave the two songwriter credits.\n\"Rapper's Delight\" is number 251 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and number 2 on VH1's 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs. It is also included on NPR's list of the 100 most important American musical works of the 20th century. It was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress in 2011. Songs on the National Recording Registry are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".The song was recorded in a single take. There are five versions of the song. \n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "说唱爽翻天", "details": "Netflix翻译为“饶舌爽翻天”"}, {"user_name": "Tian Tang", "github_handle": "Tian-Tang", "translation": "嘻哈在此", "details": "这首歌相当于是最早的第一首嘻哈歌曲，当歌曲诞生之时，Rapper这个词和嘻哈音乐，对于观众都很陌生。同时歌名创意化地使用Delight这个词，因为其即可是动词，也可是名词。与其说表示开心，不如说他用这首歌做了一个宣告/statement，Rapper在这里）（这个我问了两个美国人，都表示这个意思）"}, {"user_name": "redhousepainter", "github_handle": "redhousepainter", "translation": "饶舌歌手的喜悦", "details": "以前国内有过直译。或：说唱乐手的乐事"}]}
