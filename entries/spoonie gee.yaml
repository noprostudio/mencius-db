  extract: 'Gabriel Jackson (born May 27, 1963), better known by his stage name Spoonie
    Gee, is one of the earliest rap artists, and one of the few to have released rap
    records in the 1970s. He has been credited with originating the term hip hop and
    some of the themes in his music were precursors of gangsta rap.
