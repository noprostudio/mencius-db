While greatest hits albums are typically supported by the artist, they can also be created by record companies without express approval from the original artist as a means to generate sales. They are typically regarded as a good starting point for new fans of an artist, but are sometimes criticized by long-time fans as not inclusive enough or necessary at all.It is also common for greatest hits albums to include remixes or alternate takes of popular songs as bonus tracks to increase appeal for long-time fans (who might otherwise already own the songs included). At times, a greatest hits compilation marks the first album appearance of a successful single that was never attached to a previous studio album."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "精选", "details": ""}]}
