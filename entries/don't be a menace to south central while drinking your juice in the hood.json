The film was released in the United States on January 12, 1996.\nSimilar to I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, the film spoofs a number of African-American, coming-of-age, hood films such as Juice, Jungle Fever, South Central, Higher Learning, Do the Right Thing, Poetic Justice, New Jack City, Dead Presidents, Friday, and most prominently Boyz n the Hood, Menace II Society and Above the Rim. The film's title borrows phrases from some of those films, and some of the actors who starred in those movies appear in the film, in some cases appearing in similar roles or scenes as the films being parodied.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "笑枪走火", "details": ""}]}
