  extract: '"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" is a poem and song by Gil Scott-Heron.
    Scott-Heron first recorded it for his 1970 album Small Talk at 125th and Lenox,
    on which he recited the lyrics, accompanied by congas and bongo drums. A re-recorded
    version, with a full band, was the B-side to Scott-Heron''s first single, "Home
    Is Where the Hatred Is", from his album Pieces of a Man (1971). It was also included
    on his compilation album, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (1974). All these
    releases were issued on the Flying Dutchman Productions record label.

    The song''s title was originally a popular slogan among the 1960s Black Power
    movements in the United States. Its lyrics either mention or allude to several
    television series, advertising slogans and icons of entertainment and news coverage
    that serve as examples of what "the revolution will not" be or do. The song is
    a response to the spoken-word piece "When the Revolution Comes" by The Last Poets,
    from their eponymous debut, which opens with the line "When the revolution comes
    some of us will probably catch it on TV".It was inducted to the National Recording
    Registry in 2005.
