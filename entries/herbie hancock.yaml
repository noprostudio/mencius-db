  extract: 'Herbert Jeffrey Hancock (born April 12, 1940) is an American pianist,
    keyboardist, bandleader, composer and actor. Hancock started his career with Donald
    Byrd.  He shortly thereafter joined the Miles Davis Quintet, where he helped to
    redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section and was one of the primary architects
    of the post-bop sound.  In the 1970s, Hancock experimented with jazz fusion, funk,
    and electro styles.

    Hancock''s best-known compositions include the jazz standards "Cantaloupe Island",
    "Watermelon Man", "Maiden Voyage", and "Chameleon", as well as the hit singles
    "I Thought It Was You" and "Rockit". His 2007 tribute album River: The Joni Letters
    won the 2008 Grammy Award for Album of the Year, only the second jazz album to
    win the award, after Getz/Gilberto in 1965.'
