  extract: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962; second edition 1970; third
    edition 1996; fourth edition 2012) is a book about the history of science by the
    philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn. Its publication was a landmark event in the history,
    philosophy, and sociology of scientific knowledge.  Kuhn challenged the then prevailing
    view of progress in science in which scientific progress was viewed as "development-by-accumulation"
    of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods
    of conceptual continuity where there is cumulative progress, which Kuhn referred
    to as periods of "normal science", were interrupted by periods of revolutionary
    science. The discovery of "anomalies" during revolutions in science leads to new
    paradigms.  New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the
    mere "puzzle-solving" of the previous paradigm, change the rules of the game and
    the "map" directing new research.For example, Kuhn's analysis of the Copernican
    Revolution emphasized that, in its beginning, it did not offer more accurate predictions
    of celestial events, such as planetary positions, than the Ptolemaic system, but
    instead appealed to some practitioners based on a promise of better, simpler solutions
    that might be developed at some point in the future. Kuhn called the core concepts
    of an ascendant revolution its "paradigms" and thereby launched this word into
    widespread analogical use in the second half of the 20th century. Kuhn's insistence
    that a paradigm shift was a mélange of sociology, enthusiasm and scientific promise,
    but not a logically determinate procedure, caused an uproar in reaction to his
    work. Kuhn addressed concerns in the 1969 postscript to the second edition. For
    some commentators The Structure of Scientific Revolutions introduced a realistic
    humanism into the core of science, while for others the nobility of science was
    tarnished by Kuhn's introduction of an irrational element into the heart of its
    greatest achievements.
