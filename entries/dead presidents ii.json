It was released as the first promotional single for Jay-Z's debut album Reasonable Doubt, although it did not directly appear on the album: a different version, with the same backing track and chorus but different lyrics, called \"Dead Presidents II\", appeared on Reasonable Doubt instead. Both versions of the song are regarded as some of the greatest hip-hop songs ever recorded, and \"Dead Presidents II\" was voted #16 in About.com's Top 100 Rap Songs.\"Dead Presidents II\" also appears in the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, as part of the Doomsday Heist update, in the blonded Los Santos 97.8 FM radio station.\nThe title is slang for money because portraits of dead United States presidents appear on most Federal Reserve Notes.The song was produced by Ski. The song samples Lonnie Liston Smith's \"A Garden of Peace\" for the track's melody and A Tribe Called Quest's \"Oh My God (remix)\" for its percussion; the chorus is a sample of Nas rapping \"I'm out for dead presidents to represent me\", from his 1994 song \"The World Is Yours (Tip Mix)\"."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "钞票II", "details": ""}]}
