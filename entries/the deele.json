When the group began recording in the early 1980s, the lineup consisted of Indianapolis native Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds along with Cincinnati musicians Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, Carlos \"Satin\" Greene, Darnell \"Dee\" Bristol, Stanley \"Stick\" Burke, and Kevin \"Kayo\" Roberson.  In 2007, Bristol, Greene, Roberson & Burke reformed the group with several new members.  \nA March 2016 BET Honors performance, featuring Babyface and Reid reuniting with their former bandmates on stage, led to a more permanent reunion of the classic Deele lineup that has continued to the present."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "迪尔", "details": ""}]}
