Competing paradigms are frequently incommensurable; that is, they are competing and irreconcilable accounts of reality. Thus, our comprehension of science can never rely wholly upon \"objectivity\" alone. Science must account for subjective perspectives as well, since all objective conclusions are ultimately founded upon the subjective conditioning/worldview of its researchers and participants."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handler": "idmimida", "translation": "托马斯·库恩", "details": ""}]}
