  extract: 'Don''t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
    (or simply Don''t Be a Menace) is a 1996 American crime comedy parody film directed
    by Paris Barclay in his feature film directorial debut, and produced by Keenen
    Ivory Wayans, and also written by Wayans brothers Shawn and Marlon Wayans, who
    also both starred in the lead roles. The film was released in the United States
    on January 12, 1996.

    Similar to I''m Gonna Git You Sucka, the film spoofs a number of African-American,
    coming-of-age, hood films such as Juice, Jungle Fever, South Central, Higher Learning,
    Do the Right Thing, Poetic Justice, New Jack City, Dead Presidents, Friday, and
    most prominently Boyz n the Hood, Menace II Society and Above the Rim. The film''s
    title borrows phrases from some of those films, and some of the actors who starred
    in those movies appear in the film, in some cases appearing in similar roles or
    scenes as the films being parodied.'
