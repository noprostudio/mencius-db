  extract: 'Jacques Marie Émile Lacan (; French: [ʒak lakɑ̃]; 13 April 1901 – 9 September
    1981) was a French psychoanalyst and psychiatrist who has been called "the most
    controversial psycho-analyst since Freud". Giving yearly seminars in Paris from
    1953 to 1981, Lacan influenced many leading French intellectuals in the 1960s
    and the 1970s, especially those associated with post-structuralism. His ideas
    had a significant impact on post-structuralism, critical theory, linguistics,
    20th-century French philosophy, film theory, and clinical psychoanalysis.'
