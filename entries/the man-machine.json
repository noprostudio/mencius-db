It was released on 19 May 1978 by Kling Klang in Germany and by Capitol Records elsewhere. A further refinement of their mechanical style, the album saw the group incorporate more danceable rhythms and less minimalistic arrangements. It includes the singles \"The Model\" and \"The Robots\".\nAlthough the album was initially unsuccessful on the UK Albums Chart, it reached a new peak position of number nine in February 1982, becoming the band's second highest-peaking album in the United Kingdom after Autobahn (1974)."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "Tian Tang", "github_handler": "Tian-Tang", "translation": "人机合一", "details": "或：机型人类"}, {"user_name": "Lil Bag", "github_handler": "Lil-Bag", "translation": "人型机", "details": ""}]}
