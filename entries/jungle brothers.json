Known as the pioneers of the fusion of jazz, hip-hop, and house music, they were the first hip-hop group to collaborate with a house-music producer. The trio released their debut album, Straight out the Jungle in July 1988. Their hip-house club hit single, \"I'll House You\" was added to the album in late-1988 reissues. The single was the first non-Chicago hip-house  record. It changed the course of hip-hop and dance music by expanding it. Fostered by Kool DJ Red Alert, the Jungle Brothers success would pave the way for De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and eventually the Native Tongues collective that they founded."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "丛林兄弟", "details": ""}]}
