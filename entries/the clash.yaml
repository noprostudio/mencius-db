  extract: 'The Clash were an English rock band formed in London in 1976 as a key
    player in the original wave of British punk rock. They also contributed to the
    post-punk and new wave movements that emerged in the wake of punk and employed
    elements of a variety of genres including reggae, dub, funk, ska, and rockabilly.
    For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm
    guitarist Joe Strummer, lead guitarist and vocalist Mick Jones, bassist Paul Simonon,
    and drummer Nicky "Topper" Headon. Headon left the group in 1982 and internal
    friction led to Jones'' departure the following year. The group continued with
    new members, but finally disbanded in early 1985.

    The Clash achieved commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of
    their self-titled debut album, The Clash, in 1977. Their third album, London Calling,
    released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States
    when it was released there the following month. It was declared the best album
    of the 1980s a decade later by Rolling Stone. In 1982, they reached new heights
    of success with the release of Combat Rock, which spawned the US top 10 hit "Rock
    the Casbah", helping the album to achieve a 2× Platinum certification there. A
    final album, Cut the Crap, was released in 1985.In January 2003, shortly after
    the death of Joe Strummer, the band—including original drummer Terry Chimes—were
    inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the
    Clash number 28 on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".'
