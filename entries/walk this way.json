Written by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, the song was originally released as the second single from the album Toys in the Attic (1975). It peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1977, part of a string of successful hit singles for the band in the 1970s. In addition to being one of the songs that helped break Aerosmith into the mainstream in the 1970s, it also helped revitalize their career in the 1980s when it was covered by hip hop group Run–D.M.C. on their 1986 album Raising Hell. This cover was a touchstone for the new musical subgenre of rap rock, or the melding of rock and hip hop. It became an international hit and won both groups a Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap Single in 1987 Soul Train Music Awards."}, "opinions": [{"mimida": {"user_name": "mimida", "github_handler": "mimida", "translation": "行此路", "details": ""}}, {"redhousepainter": {"user_name": "redhousepainter", "github_handler": "redhousepainter", "translation": "走这边/勇往直前", "details": "之前有人直接翻：走这条路"}}]}
