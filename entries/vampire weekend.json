The band was formed by lead vocalist and guitarist Ezra Koenig, multi-instrumentalist Rostam Batmanglij, drummer Chris Tomson, and bassist Chris Baio. The band's eponymous first album Vampire Weekend (2008)—which included the singles \"Mansard Roof\", \"A-Punk\", \"Oxford Comma\", \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\", and \"The Kids Don't Stand a Chance\"—was acclaimed by critics for its world music influences. Their following album, Contra (2010), was similarly acclaimed and garnered strong commercial success. Their third studio album, Modern Vampires of the City (2013), won the group a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2014. Batmanglij departed the group in early 2016. The band's fourth album, Father of the Bride, was released in 2019, again winning Best Alternative Music Album at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, where it was also nominated for Album of the Year.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "吸血鬼周末", "details": ""}]}
