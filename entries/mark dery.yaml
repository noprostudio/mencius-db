  extract: 'Mark Dery (born December 24, 1959) is an American author, lecturer and
    cultural critic. An early observer and critic of online culture, he helped to
    popularize the term ''culture jamming'' and is generally credited with having
    coined the term ''Afrofuturism'' in his essay "Black to the Future" in the anthology
    Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture. He writes about media and visual culture,
    especially fringe elements of culture for a wide variety of publications, from
    Rolling Stone to BoingBoing.'
