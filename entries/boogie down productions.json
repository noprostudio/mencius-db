DJ Scott La Rock was murdered on August 27, 1987, five months after the release of BDP's debut album, Criminal Minded. The name of the group, Boogie Down, derives from a nickname for the South Bronx section of The Bronx, one of the five boroughs of New York City. The group pioneered the fusion of dancehall reggae and hip hop music and their debut LP Criminal Minded contained frank descriptions of life in the South Bronx during the late 1980s, thus setting the stage for what would eventually become gangsta rap.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "布吉唐制作", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "Tian Tang", "github_handle": "Tian-Tang", "translation": "布吉唐制作", "details": "音译挺好的"}, {"user_name": "Lil Bag", "github_handle": "Lil-Bag", "translation": "布吉唐制作", "details": "可以解释下Boogie Down是The Bronx的在80年代外号，所以其实意思就是布朗克斯的产物、布朗克斯名物的意思"}]}
