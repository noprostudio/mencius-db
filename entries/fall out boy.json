The band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which all members were involved at one point. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of the members' respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording the group's debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003). The album became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, as well as commercial success. Take This to Your Grave has commonly been cited as an influential blueprint for pop punk music in the 2000s.\nWith Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, the band's 2005 major-label breakthrough, From Under the Cork Tree, produced two hit singles, \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" and \"Dance, Dance\", and went double platinum, transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards. The band's 2007 follow-up, Infinity on High, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" and \"Thnks fr th Mmrs\". Folie à Deux, the band's fourth album, created a mixed response from fans and commercially undersold expectations. Following the release of Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits, the band took a hiatus from 2009 to 2012 to \"decompress\", exploring various side projects.\nThe band regrouped and recorded Save Rock and Roll (2013), becoming its second career number one and included the top 20 single \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\". The same year, the band released the EP PAX AM Days, consisting of 8 punk-influenced tracks that were recorded during a two-day session with producer Ryan Adams. The band's sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho (2015) peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, and spawned the top-10 hit \"Centuries\" and the single \"Uma Thurman\" which reached No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100. This was followed by their first remix album Make America Psycho Again, which featured the remixes of all original tracks from American Beauty/American Psycho by a different artist on each song, including Migos and Wiz Khalifa.\nThe band's seventh studio album Mania (2018), also peaked at No. 1, making it the band's fourth No. 1 album and sixth consecutive top 10 album. Their supporting tour for the album included a show at Wrigley Field, their first headlining stadium show. In 2018, Fall Out Boy also received their second Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album for Mania. A co-headlining 2020 tour with Green Day and Weezer titled the Hella Mega Tour was announced in September 2019. Each band released new music in support of the tour, with Fall Out Boy announcing the release of a second greatest hits album, Greatest Hits: Believers Never Die – Volume Two, and a supporting single, Dear Future Self (Hands Up). The tour, which spans North American, Europe and Oceania, is Fall Out Boy's first stadium tour and includes shows in Wrigley Field, Dodger Stadium and the London Stadium. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, part of the tour has been rescheduled."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "放射性微尘男孩", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "redhousepainter", "github_handle": "redhousepainter", "translation": "辐射男孩", "details": ""}]}
