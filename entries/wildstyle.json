Due to its complexity, it is often very hard to read by people who are not familiar with it. Usually, this form of graffiti incorporates interwoven and overlapping letters and shapes. It may include arrows, spikes, and other decorative elements depending on the technique used. The numerous layers and shapes make this style extremely difficult to produce homogeneously, which is why developing an original style in this field is seen as one of the greatest artistic challenges to a graffiti writer. Wildstyle pieces are the most complex form of piece (\"masterpiece\") lettering, a stage higher than the quick simplified stylised letters  known as \"burners\". Wildstyle is seen as one of the most complicated and difficult masterpiece styles and refers to larger complex letters which have volume as opposed to mere signatures or graffiti art \"tags\"."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handler": "mimida", "translation": "狂野风格", "details": ""}]}
