  extract: 'Jalal (Arabic: جلال), a masculine name, means majesty, dignity, lordliness,
    and glory. Because of its majestic and glorious meanings, Jalal is used as an
    attribute of God in the Bible, Psalms and Christian hymns, and in the Quran, and
    as a characteristic of royals like kings, lords, monarchs, and emperors in histories,
    myths, legends, monarchies, and formal situations. When the Arabs spread their
    language across non-Arabic countries, "Jalal" among other Arabic words has been
    added to other language dictionaries of non-Arabic people. Many Arabic-speaking
    Christians and Arab or non-Arab Muslims have Jalal as given or family name.


    Another form of the name is the Arabic spelling variant "Galal", mostly in the
    Egyptian Arabic dialect where the letter "j" or in Arabic "ج" is pronounced like
    the hard g /g/ in English as (garden, gather...), and it is written with the "G"
    to differentiate the pronunciation. The word "Galal" found in other languages
    or as country names could have other meanings.'
