It is considered a highly influential hip hop album and one of the first in the gangsta rap genre.Since its release, the album has been sampled, interpolated and paraphrased. Its samples and direct influences were unusual at the time, ranging from liberal use of dancehall reggae (as well as the more commonly used James Brown) to rock music artists such as AC/DC, The Beatles and Billy Joel. The album was eventually certified Gold by the RIAA. The songs \"South Bronx\" and \"The Bridge Is Over\" ignited the rivalry with the Brooklyn-bred but Queens resident emcee MC Shan and the Juice Crew. The former has second-hand musical ideas from Public Enemy and contributed to the new jack swing genre. The latter took ideas from MC Shan. Throughout the album, KRS-One gives honor and praise to Scott La Rock for producing the album and he mostly goes on about the importance of originality and being \"real\" instead of a \"Sucker MC\".\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 444 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "犯罪思维", "details": ""}]}
