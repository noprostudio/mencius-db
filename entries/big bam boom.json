It marked the end of one of the most successful album runs by a duo of the 1980s. RCA issued a remastered version in July 2004 with four bonus tracks. The song \"Out of Touch\" (the first single) was a #1 pop hit, and charted in several other areas (#24 Hot Black Singles, #8 on the Adult Contemporary charts and #1 on the dance charts, #48 in the UK). Another song taken from the album, the Daryl Hall and Janna Allen-penned \"Method of Modern Love\" reached a high point of #5, and \"Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid,\" reached #18.\nMusical styles on the album include pop, rock, and dance-rock, with R&B/soul influences. The album had even more of an electronic, urban feel to it compared to their previous albums, combining their song structure & vocalization with the latest technical advances in recording and playing. The album employed some of the most sophisticated equipment ever used in the recording industry at the time.Big Bam Boom peaked at No. 5 in the United States and sold over three million copies worldwide."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handler": "idmimida", "translation": "乒铃乓啷", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "Tian Tang", "github_handler": "Tian-Tang", "translation": "噪很大", "details": "bam boom是鼓点的拟声词"}]}
