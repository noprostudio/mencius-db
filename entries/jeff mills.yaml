  extract: 'Jeff Mills (born June 18, 1963, in Detroit, Michigan) is an American DJ,
    record producer and composer. Thanks to his technical abilities as a DJ, Mills
    became known as The Wizard in the early to mid 1980s. In the late 1980s Mills
    founded the techno collective Underground Resistance with fellow Detroit techno
    producers ''Mad'' Mike Banks and Robert Hood but left the group to pursue a career
    as a solo artist in the early 90s. Mills founded Axis Records in 1992. The label
    is based in Chicago, Illinois and is responsible for the release of much of his
    solo work.

    Mills has received international recognition for his work both as a DJ and producer.
    Mills was also featured in Man From Tomorrow, a documentary about techno music
    that he produced along with French filmmaker Jacqueline Caux. He continued working
    in film, releasing Life to Death and Back, a film he shot in the Egyptian wing
    of the Louvre Museum where he also had a four-month residency. In 2017 the French
    Minister of Culture Jack Lang awarded Mills the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres
    for his services to the arts.'
