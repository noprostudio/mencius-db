Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "电音香水", "details": ""}]}
