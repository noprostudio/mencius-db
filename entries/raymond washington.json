In 1971, Washington formed an alliance with Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams, establishing the Crips as the first major African-American street gang in Los Angeles, and served as one of the co-leaders. In 1974, Washington was convicted of robbery and received a five-year prison sentence, during which his leadership and influence in the Crips declined.\nOn August 9, 1979, Washington was murdered in a drive-by shooting shortly after his release."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "雷蒙德·华盛顿", "details": ""}]}
