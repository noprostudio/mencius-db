  extract: Bobby Howard Byrd (August 15, 1934 – September 12, 2007) was an American
    R&B/soul singer, songwriter, bandleader, talent scout, record producer, and musician,
    who played an integral and important part in the development of soul and funk
    music in association with James Brown. Byrd began his career in 1952 as member
    of the gospel group the Gospel Starlighters, who later changed their name to the
    Avons in 1953 and the Five Royals in 1954, before settling with the name the Flames
    in 1955 prior to Brown's joining the group; their agent later changed it to The
    Famous Flames. Byrd was the actual founder of The Flames and is credited with
    the discovery of James Brown. He also claims responsibility for writing most of
    James Brown's hits. As group founder, and one of the longest-serving members of
    the group, Byrd was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame posthumously in
    2012. Byrd was also a 1998 recipient of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer
    Award. Byrd helped to inspire the musical aspirations of James Brown, who launched
    his career with Byrd.
