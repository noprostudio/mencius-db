It is the best-selling manga magazine, as well as one of the longest-running; the first issue was released with a cover date of August 1, 1968. The manga series within the magazine target young male readers and tend to consist of many action scenes and a fair amount of comedy. The chapters of series that run in Weekly Shōnen Jump are collected and published in tankōbon volumes under the \"Jump Comics\" imprint every two to three months.\nThe mid-1980s to the mid-1990s represents the era when the magazine's circulation was at its highest, 6.53 million copies per week. Throughout 2019, it had an average circulation of 1.6 million copies. The magazine sold over 7.5 billion copies since 1968, making it the best-selling comic/manga magazine. Many of the best-selling manga originate from Weekly Shōnen Jump.\nShōnen Jump spawned the Jump magazine line as well as the Jump Comics imprint label for publishing tankōbon. Weekly Shōnen Jump has two sister magazines called Jump SQ, created after the fall of Monthly Shōnen Jump, and Saikyō Jump. The magazine has also had several international counterparts, including the current North American Weekly Shonen Jump. It also spawned a crossover media franchise including anime and video games (since Famicom Jump) which bring together various Shōnen Jump characters."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "少年跳跃", "details": ""}]}
