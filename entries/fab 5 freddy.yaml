  extract: Fred Brathwaite (born August 31, 1959), more popularly known as Fab 5 Freddy,
    is an American visual artist, filmmaker, and hip hop pioneer.  He emerged in New
    York's downtown underground creative scene in the late 1970s as a camera operator
    and a regular guest on Glenn O'Brien's public access cable show TV Party. There
    he met Chris Stein and Debbie Harry. He was immortalized in 1981 when Harry rapped
    on the Blondie song "Rapture" that "Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody's fly." In
    the late 1980s, Fab 5 Freddy became the first host of the groundbreaking and first
    internationally telecast hip-hop music video show Yo! MTV Raps.
