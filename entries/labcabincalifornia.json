The album's production was handled by The Pharcyde themselves and Jay Dee, with additional help from Diamond D and M-Walk.\nThe first single was \"Drop\".  The video for \"Drop\" was directed by Spike Jonze, and used footage  of the group performing the song backwards, replayed backwards, giving it a surreal quality. The backwards theme of the video is also a reference to the song itself, which features a backwards sample. \"Drop\" was a hit, as was the follow-up single \"Runnin',\" which peaked at #55 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nOverall, this album is a more mellow and introspective affair than their debut and features more somber themes such as dealing with fame and success, drug abuse, and broken down relationships.\nAlbum sales compared to Bizarre Ride did not fare as well; the group was not able to reach Gold status. After Labcabincalifornia was released, Fatlip left the group to concentrate on his solo career."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "加州实验室小屋", "details": ""}]}
