Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions  and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. He remains one of the most influential saxophonists in music history. He received many posthumous awards, including canonization by the African Orthodox Church and a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. His second wife was pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane.  Their children Ravi Coltrane, Oran Coltrane and John Coltrane Jr. are all musicians."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "约翰·柯川", "details": ""}]}
