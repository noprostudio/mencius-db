  extract: 'The Man-Machine (German: Die Mensch-Maschine) is the seventh studio album
    by German electronic music band Kraftwerk. It was released on 19 May 1978 by Kling
    Klang in Germany and by Capitol Records elsewhere. A further refinement of their
    mechanical style, the album saw the group incorporate more danceable rhythms and
    less minimalistic arrangements. It includes the singles "The Model" and "The Robots".

    Although the album was initially unsuccessful on the UK Albums Chart, it reached
    a new peak position of number nine in February 1982, becoming the band''s second
    highest-peaking album in the United Kingdom after Autobahn (1974).'
