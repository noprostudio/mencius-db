It was orchestrated by Ferde Grofé several times, including the original 1924 scoring, the 1926 \"theater orchestra\" setting, and the 1942 symphony orchestra scoring, though completed earlier. The piece received its premiere in the concert, An Experiment in Modern Music, which was held on February 12, 1924, in Aeolian Hall, New York City, by Whiteman and his band with Gershwin playing the piano.\nThe editors of the Cambridge Music Handbooks opined that \"The Rhapsody in Blue (1924) established Gershwin's reputation as a serious composer and has since become one of the most popular of all American concert works.\"\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "蓝色狂想曲", "details": ""}]}
