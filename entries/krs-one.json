He rose to prominence as part of the hip hop music group Boogie Down Productions, which he formed with DJ Scott La Rock in the mid-1980s. KRS-One is best known for his top hits, \"Sound of da Police\", \"Love's Gonna Get'cha (Material Love)\", and \"My Philosophy\", among others. Boogie Down Productions received numerous awards and critical acclaim in their early years. Unfortunately, following the release of the group's debut album, Criminal Minded, fellow artist Scott La Rock was shot and killed, but KRS-One continued the group, effectively as a solo project. He began releasing records under his own name in 1993. He is politically active, having started the Stop the Violence Movement after Scott's death. He's also a vegan activist, expressed in songs such as \"Beef\". He is widely considered as an influence to  many well known hip hop artists, such as 2Pac and Eminem just to name a few."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "KRS-One", "details": "google里看到“救世王”这个翻译，在中文语境里常见吗？"}]}
