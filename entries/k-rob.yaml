  extract: Malik Johnson, better known as K-Rob, is an American rapper, most famous
    for providing vocals for "Beat Bop" with Rammellzee in 1983 and "I'm a Homeboy",
    a single under his own name, in 1986. "The Day K-Rob Came Back" was also released
    in 1986. Since the 1980s, however, aside from providing a verse for "Beat Bop
    Part 2" on 2004's Bi-Conicals of the Rammellzee, K-Rob has devoted himself more
    to his Muslim faith.
