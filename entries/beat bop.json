It was initially distributed merely as a test pressing. Its cover was designed by New York City graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. The result of a disagreement between Rammellzee and Basquiat, the track has been cited as having an influence on artists such as Beastie Boys and many experimental hip hop artists due to its chaotic, abstract sound.\nDue to the rarity of its original pressing, it has been called the Holy Grail of rap records. It is featured in the hip-hop documentary film Style Wars."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "节奏咆勃", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "Tian Tang", "github_handle": "Tian-Tang", "translation": "Beat Bop", "details": "两种猜测，1- 可能是“Bop your head to the beat”， 2- 可能是对爵士乐中的Bebop的的说话的旧瓶装新酒。"}]}
