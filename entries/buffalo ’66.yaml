  extract: 'Buffalo ''66 is a 1998 crime comedy-drama film written and directed by
    Vincent Gallo, starring Gallo, Christina Ricci,  Mickey Rourke, Rosanna Arquette,
    Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston. The plot revolves around Billy Brown (Gallo),
    a man who kidnaps a young tapdancer (Ricci) and forces her to pretend to be his
    wife to impress his parents (Gazzara and Huston) after he gets released from prison.

    The film was generally well-received; Empire listed it as the 36th-greatest independent
    film ever made. It was filmed in and around Gallo''s hometown of Buffalo, New
    York, in winter.

    The title refers to the Buffalo Bills American football team, who had not won
    a championship since the 1965 American Football League Championship Game (which
    was actually played on December 28, 1965, four days before 1966 began). The plot
    involves indirect references to the Bills'' narrow loss to the New York Giants
    in Super Bowl XXV, which was decided by a missed field goal.'
