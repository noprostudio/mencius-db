Born in Wilmington, North Carolina, she grew up in the South Bronx, New York City during the earliest years of hip hop culture.  Within the hip-hop community she has been referred to as the \"Mother of the Mic\" signifying her role as a prominent female figure among the early rappers. As a member of the first hip-hop crew to appear on television, known as the Funky 4 + 1, her style of delivering raps on early mixtapes influenced notable rappers like MC Lyte and DMC (born Darryl McDaniels) of Run-DMC. McDaniels cited Green as a significant influence on the style of rapping associated with the pioneering group.Despite the fact that Green was one of the founding members of the Funky 4 + 1, her role, as well as her early contributions, are repeatedly diminished by mistakenly assuming she was the \"+1\" because she was the sole woman in the group.  Women's roles in general are often downplayed due to the prevalence of male rappers throughout the history of rap."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "夏-洛克", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "Lil Bag", "github_handle": "Lil-Bag", "translation": "莉儿·金", "details": ""}]}
