The best-known version is named after Buffalo, New York.The chorus is:\n\nBuffalo gals, won't you come out tonight?\nCome out tonight,\nCome out tonight?\nBuffalo gals, won't you come out tonight,\nAnd dance by the light of the moon?The Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western Songs of all time."}, "opinions": [{"mimida": {"user_name": "mimida", "github_handler": "mimida", "translation": "水牛城女孩", "details": ""}}]}
