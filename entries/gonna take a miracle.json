It was released on Columbia Records in November 1971, one year after its predecessor, Christmas and the Beads of Sweat. The album is Nyro's only all-covers album, and she interprets mainly 1950s and 1960s soul and R&B standards, using Labelle as a traditional back-up vocal group.\nNyro had originally hatched the idea to do a covers album during 1970, and on her tour to support the Christmas and the Beads of Sweat album she introduced several of the songs that would later appear on Gonna Take a Miracle, including \"Spanish Harlem\" and \"Dancing in the Street\".\nGonna Take a Miracle remains a critics' favorite Laura Nyro record for its laidback atmosphere and impressive soul grooves and musicianship, as well as classic \"Philadelphia soul\" production from Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. It was her last commercially successful album, peaking at #46 on the Billboard 200, then known as the Pop Albums chart, as well as #41 on the Black Albums chart.\nThe album was Nyro's last for over four years as she turned her back on the music industry to get married and live a rural life away from the spotlight. Her work with Patti LaBelle on the album formed a lifelong friendship.\nIn 2005, music magazine The Word voted Gonna Take a Miracle among the 60 Best Underrated Albums of All Time."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "除非发生奇迹", "details": ""}]}
