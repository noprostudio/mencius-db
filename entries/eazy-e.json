After a short solo career with frequent collaboration with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, they joined, forming N.W.A, later that year.\nN.W.A's debut studio album, Straight Outta Compton, was released in 1988. Controversial upon release, it is now ranked among the greatest and most influential albums. The group released its third and final studio album, Niggaz4Life, in 1991, and soon after disbanded.\nDuring N.W.A's splintering, largely by disputes over money, Eazy-E became embroiled in bitter rivalries with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, who had departed for solo careers in 1989 and 1991, respectively. Resuming his solo career, Eazy-E released two EPs. Yet he remained more significant behind the scenes, signing and nationally debuting the rap group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony from 1993 to 1994.\nIn 1995, Eazy-E was suddenly hospitalized and diagnosed with AIDS, and died due to its complications."}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "伊基-E", "details": "Eazy在中文界通常是否需要意译？"}, {"user_name": "Tian Tang", "github_handle": "Tian-Tang", "translation": "idk…", "details": ""}, {"user_name": "redhousepainter", "github_handle": "redhousepainter", "translation": "伊基-E", "details": "之前有翻：从容的e；随和的e，都蛮崩溃的"}, {"user_name": "Lil Bag", "github_handle": "Lil-Bag", "translation": "随和E", "details": ""}]}
