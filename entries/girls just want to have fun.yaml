  extract: '"Girls Just Want to Have Fun" is a song written and first recorded in
    1979 by American musician Robert Hazard. It is better known as a single by American
    singer Cyndi Lauper, whose version was released in 1983. It was the first major
    single released by Lauper as a solo artist and the lead single from her debut
    studio album She''s So Unusual (1983). Lauper’s version gained recognition as
    a feminist anthem and was promoted by a Grammy-winning music video. It has been
    covered, either as a studio recording or in a live performance, by over 30 other
    artists.

    The single was Lauper''s breakthrough hit, reaching number two on the US Billboard
    Hot 100 chart and becoming a worldwide hit throughout late 1983 and early 1984.
    It remains one of Lauper''s signature songs and was a widely popular song during
    the era of its release, the 1980s. The "Rolling Stone & MTV: ''100 Greatest Pop
    Songs'': 1-50", "Rolling Stone: "The 100 Top Music Videos"" and the "VH1: 100
    Greatest Videos" lists ranked the song at No. 22, No. 39 and No. 45, respectively.
    The song received Grammy Award nominations for Record of the Year and Best Female
    Pop Vocal Performance. In 2013, the song was remixed by Yolanda Be Cool, taken
    from the 30th anniversary reissue of She''s So Unusual.
