They are ascribed various and conflicting abilities, temperaments and appearances depending on the story and country of origin. They are almost always small and grotesque, mischievous or outright malicious, and greedy, especially for gold and jewelry. They often have magical abilities similar to a fairy or demon. Similar creatures include brownies, dwarfs, duendes, gnomes, imps, and kobolds.\n\n"}, "opinions": [{"user_name": "mimida", "github_handle": "idmimida", "translation": "小妖精", "details": "这个词条的问题其实属于第六章，Tyler的艺名“Creator”来源是他当时运营了三个myspace账号，其中一个专门发作品的就很直接地命名为“Tyler, the Creator”，所以应该是“创造者泰勒”。但是包括维基和一些媒体在内，现在都翻成“造物主泰勒”。是否有必要与现成常见的翻译保持一致？我觉得是不是改回“创造者”比较好？"}]}
